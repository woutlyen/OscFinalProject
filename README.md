# OscFinalProject
This repository contains the code for the final project of the Operating Systems course.

the goal is to create a sensor monitoring system that consists of client-side sensor nodes measuring the room temperature, and a central server-side sensor-gateway that acquires all sensor data from the sensor nodes. A sensor node uses a TCP connection to transfer the sensor data to the sensor gateway.
